# Assignment 4

1. Implement a linear linked list class which performs insertion (at begining) and deletion as given the key.  
You should have atleast these member functions:  
-	initialize (construct), 
-	deconstruct, 
-	display, 
-	insetBeg,
-	delete, 
-	concatenate, 
-	search
Show the use of the class by creating objects and calling the member functions. Use your own random number to generate values to insert and delete.

2. Write a hashing class which uses the linked list class header file to implement open hashing using Channing.  
Use modular hash function (x%10).  Generate 100 random int key values and insert each of them and perform searching.  
Report the % of load in each of 10 buckets. Try any other different hash function and report which one is better.  
Implement the following methods
-	Search
-	Insert
-	Delete
-	Display
-	TableLoadDistr  

3. Write a Graph data structure (as adjacency list) class which uses linked list class header file. Use the sll class header file and stack (for dfs) class header file for implementation. Provide suitable interface to find 
-	the shortest path among a pair of vertices using dijkstraâ€™s algorithm
-	dfs traversal
-	find number of connected components and their sizes
Use the provided files as adjacency information

4.  Write a Binary search tree (BST) Class. Define suitable doubly linked node structure for this which will be used by the BST class. Implement the methods
-	insert
-	delete
-	search
-	display
-	findheight
-	dfs
-	bfs
