# Assignment 5

Objective(s): Learn to implement the following features  
- Binary and Unary Operator Overloading
- Cascaded calls to overloaded I/O (streaming) operators
- Overloading new and delete operator
- Composition (has-a) relation among classes [Ex: linked_list class which in turn uses the node class]

1. Implement a Complex class which performs the following operations:
Add ```+```, Subtract ```-```, Multiply ```*```, Divide ```/```, Conjugate ```!```, Compare ```==```,```!=```, Copy ```=```,  Subscript ```[]``` – Returns real for [0] and img for [1], Input-Output ```>>```,```<<```

2. Implement a Fraction class which performs the following operations:
Add ```+```, Subtract ```-```, Multiply ```*```, Divide ```/```, Normalize ```Unary *```, Compare ```==```,```!=, <, >```, Copy ```=```, Subscript ```[]``` – Returns numerator for [0] and denominator for [1], Input-Output ```>>```,```<<```

3. Implement a Matrix class (Don’t forget to add copy constructor) which performs the following operations:
Add ```+```, Subtract ```-```, Multiply ```*```, Divide ```/```, Invert ``` ! ```, Compare ```==```, Copy ```=```, Subscript ```[]``` – Check and display message for out of bound access, Allocation/Deallocation ```new, delete```,  Input-Output ```>>```,```<<```

4. Implement a  Set class (Don’t forget to add copy constructor) which performs the following operations:
Union ```+```, Difference ```-```, Intersection ```*```, Subset ```<, <=```, Superset ```>, >=```, Compare ```==```,```!=```, Input-Output ```>>```,```<<```

5. Implement a  Linked List class (Don’t forget to add copy constructor) which performs the following operations:
Concatenate ```+```, Reverse ```!```, Compare ```==```, Copy ```=```, Subscript ```[]``` – Check and display message when index is more than the size of the list, Allocation/Deallocation ```new, delete``` – Using avail list,  Input-Output ```>>```,```<<```
